# Welcome to Performance Testing Suite!

A HTTP/1.1 benchmarking tool which contains a client and a server created on ReactJS and NodeJS which is built on top of [autocannon](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon) module & [react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2) module.
Build on top of websockets, this gives a very reactive and user friendly UI which provides the capability of running performance on any given endpoint using websockets.

# Install

Navigate to the project's server/client folder and run ```npm install```

# Usage

Run server first using ``` npm start ```and then run the client using ```npm start``` to get the entire suite up and running *and* connected to each other through websockets.
UI is pretty self explanatory which can then be used to run performance. 


# Acknowledgements

This project was created for fun by [Deepak Bhat](https://github.com/dbhat6).

[autocannon](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon) module & [react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2) modules provided great inspiration which is used to create this project.

Just a fun, pet project :))
